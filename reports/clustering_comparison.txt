                        K-MEANS vs DBSCAN COMPARISON                         
================================================================================

METRIC                    K-MEANS (k=3)              DBSCAN (eps=1.65)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Number of Clusters        3 (predefined)             1 (discovered)
Outliers Detected         0                          4 (3.5%)
Silhouette Score          0.341                   N/A (only 1 cluster)
Davies-Bouldin Index      0.980                   N/A
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTERPRETABILITY:
  K-Means: Highly interpretable - created 3 distinct runner archetypes
  DBSCAN:  Limited value - identified all runners as one large group

EASE OF IMPLEMENTATION:
  K-Means: Simple to tune and deploy - only requires choosing k
  DBSCAN:  Complex tuning - tried multiple eps values, still only found 1 cluster

PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
  K-Means: Perfect for personalized training recommendations
  DBSCAN:  Cannot differentiate between athletes meaningfully

KEY FINDINGS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
K-Means successfully identified 3 distinct training profiles:
    - The Consistent Cruiser/Core: 60 athletes (52.2%)
    - The Foundation Builder/Base: 41 athletes (35.7%)
    - The Competative Peak/Prime: 14 athletes (12.2%)

DBSCAN found that most runners form one continuous group:
    - Identified 4 outlier athletes (3.5%)
    - Remaining 111 athletes (96.5%) grouped together
    - Confirms that running fitness exists on a continuum rather than in distinct categories
    - Makes sense intuitively: beginners gradually become intermediate, then advanced

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL RECOMMENDATION: K-MEANS (k=3)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY K-MEANS IS THE RIGHT CHOICE:

  1. Creates meaningful, actionable groups for personalized training
  2. Easy to explain to users: "You're a The Foundation Builder/Base"
  3. Simple to implement for new user onboarding
  4. Provides specific recommendations per cluster
  5. Achieves good cluster separation (Silhouette Score = 0.341)

WHY DBSCAN WAS NOT SUITABLE:

  1. Only identified one large cluster (not useful for differentiation)
  2. Confirms runners exist on a spectrum, not in distinct groups
  3. Cannot provide differentiated advice to users
  4. Would give same recommendations to 96.5% of athletes

CONCLUSION:

While DBSCAN correctly identified that runners exist on a continuum, K-Means 
provides more practical value for this application. The forced separation into 
3 distinct groups allows for personalized training recommendations while still 
reflecting meaningful differences in training patterns and fitness levels.

This is a common scenario in consumer applications: even when data naturally 
forms a continuum, discrete categories provide better user experience and more 
actionable insights.

IMPLEMENTATION FOR RUNNING PLAN BUILDER APP:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. New user completes onboarding questionnaire
  2. Calculate user's 6 profile features:
     - Average weekly mileage
     - Average pace (min/km)
     - Training days per week
     - Fatigue index
     - Consistency index
     - Recovery ratio
  3. Scale features using clustering_scaler.pkl
  4. Assign user to nearest K-Means cluster centroid
  5. Display: "Based on your training history, you're a The Foundation Builder/Base"
  6. Provide personalized recommendations from cluster_profiles.json
  7. Generate training plan tailored to their cluster profile
