CLUSTER BREAKDOWN:
================================================================================

CLUSTER 0: The Consistent Cruiser/Core
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Population: 60 athletes (52.2%)

Profile:
  • Weekly Mileage:     18.9 miles
  • Pace:               9.94 min/mile
  • Training Days:      2.7 days/week
  • Fatigue Index:      24.1
  • Consistency:        7.3
  • Recovery Ratio:     2.40

Description:
  This athlete maintains a solid training routine with moderate mileage and consistent training days.
They balance their training well, showing good consistency and recovery, making them reliable performers.
This profile suggests a dedicated runner who values steady progress and injury prevention.

Training Recommendations:
  1. Introduce one 'quality' day per week (e.g. tempo run or intervals) to improve pace.
2. To build endurance, gradually increase long run distance by 10 percent every 1-2 weeks.
3. Use cross-training (cycling, swimming) on rest days to enhance aerobic fitness without extra running stress.


CLUSTER 1: The Foundation Builder/Base
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Population: 41 athletes (35.7%)

Profile:
  • Weekly Mileage:     10.3 miles
  • Pace:               9.98 min/mile
  • Training Days:      1.9 days/week
  • Fatigue Index:      6.9
  • Consistency:        4.4
  • Recovery Ratio:     3.75

Description:
  This athlete is likely in the early stages of their running journey or focusing on building a solid foundation.
They have lower mileage and fewer training days (maybe due to a busy schedule), which is appropriate for their current fitness level.
This profile indicates a focus on gradual improvement and injury prevention.

Training Recommendations:
  1. Focus on making running a consistent habit. Aim for 3 days/week, even if mileage is low.
2. Gradually increase weekly mileage by no more than 10 percent per week to build endurance safely.
3. Prioritize injury prevention with proper warm-up, cool-downs, and good running form.
4. Incorporate strength training and flexibility exercises to support running form and prevent injuries.


CLUSTER 2: The Competative Peak/Prime
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Population: 14 athletes (12.2%)

Profile:
  • Weekly Mileage:     32.1 miles
  • Pace:               8.82 min/mile
  • Training Days:      4.5 days/week
  • Fatigue Index:      141.7
  • Consistency:        9.6
  • Recovery Ratio:     1.00

Description:
  This athlete trains at a high level, has frequent training days, and is an experienced runner.
They are likely preparing for competitive events and have a strong commitment to their training regimen.
This all comes with a very high fatigue index, indicating they are pushing their limits regularly. for competitive performance.

Training Recommendations:
  1. Focus on race-specific training: Incorporate interval training, tempo runs, and long runs tailored to race goals.
2. Prioritize active recovery: Focus on sleep, nutrition, foam rolling, and stretching.
3. Implement structured periodization to manage fatigue and peak for key races.
4. Monitor for signs of overtraining, given the high fatigue and low recovery scores.


================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS:
================================================================================
  ✓ Three distinct athlete profiles successfully identified
  ✓ Clear progression: Foundation Builder → Consistent Cruiser → Competitive Peak
  ✓ Each cluster has unique training needs and recovery requirements
  ✓ 52.2% are intermediate runners (largest group)
  ✓ 12.2% are elite/competitive runners (need careful fatigue management)
  ✓ 35.7% are building base fitness (focus on consistency)

================================================================================
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:
================================================================================
  1. Personalized Training Plans: Assign different workout types per cluster
  2. Injury Prevention: Cluster 2 needs enhanced recovery protocols
  3. Progress Tracking: Monitor athletes moving between clusters
  4. New Athlete Onboarding: Predict cluster membership for recommendations
  5. Resource Allocation: Focus coaching attention where most needed
